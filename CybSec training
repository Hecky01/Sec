I just started CybSec training for begginers. 
What i learn today:
  The CIA triad;
  Security risk (Risk management strategies)
  Some of certifications for profesionals;
  (some) Types of ciphers.
Now I'll continue My journey of learning NetSec/CybSec 
(this sounds pathetic but I want to start somewhere as I dont have anybody who could guide me xd)
